Two consecutive falling tones
=============================
When two falling tones, the first falling tone is replaced by a rising tone [YLC7]_.
 
Example: Wǒ búshì jiānádà rén. (我不是加拿大人)
|
   Here we initially have bùshì (two falling tones) which should be replaced with búshì.

|

`:information_source:`

   Google translate doesn't seem to follow this rule since it uses instead bùshì for translating "I am not". [GTFT]_
