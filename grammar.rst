Measure words
=============
Use a measure word (MW) in a sentence when stating the quantity of a thing (e.g. apple, friend).
The measure word to be used depends on the type of the thing (e.g. zhāng for rectangular or 
flag objects and zhǐ for some animals).


`:star:`

   - General rule for MW : number + measure word + noun
   - Rule for MW in a question: Nǐ yǒu jǐ + MW + noun? (How many + noun + do you have?)

|

Some measure words:

- gè 个: most common MW
- píng 瓶: for a bottle of something (e.g. water)
- běn 本: used for books and magazines
- zhǐ 只: used for some animals like dog, cat, and rabbit
- jiàn 件: used for clothes and luggages
- tiáo 条: used for long winding objects (e.g. snake)
- shuāng 双: used for a pair of items (e.g. pair of socks)
-

**Examples with gè:**

- Yī **gè** péngyǒu (一个朋友) translates to "One friend"

   Here **gè** is a measure word.

- Sān **gè** hǎo péngyǒu (三个好朋友) translates to "Three good friends"
- Liǎng **gè** píngguǒ (两个苹果) translates to "Two apples"

   Always use liǎng (2) before a MW instead of èr (2)
- Nǐ yǒu jǐ **gè** píngguǒ? (你有几个苹果?) translates to "How many apples do you have?"

   yǒu (有): to have
   jǐ (几): how many
   
**Examples with gè:**

- Yī píng shuǐ (一瓶水) translates to "A bottle of water"
- Yī píng hóngjiǔ (一瓶红酒) translates to "A bottle of wine"

**Examples with běn:**

- Yī **běn** shū (一本书) translates to "A book"
- Wǒ yǒuyī **běn** zázhì (我有一本杂志) translates to "I have a magazine"
- Nǐ yǒu jǐ **běn** zázhì? (你有几本杂志?) translates to "How many magazines do you have?"
- Wǒ yǒu liù **běn** shū (我有六本书) translates to "I have six books"

   You don't have to specify the objects so you could say: Wǒ yǒu liù běn

Two consecutive falling tones
=============================
When one falling tone is followed by another falling tone, the first falling tone is replaced by a rising tone [YLC7]_.
 
Example: Wǒ búshì jiānádà rén (我不是加拿大人) which means "I am not canadian"

   Here we initially have bùshì (two falling tones) which should be replaced with búshì.

|

`:information_source:`

   Google Translate doesn't seem to follow this rule since it uses instead bùshì for translating "I am not". [GTFT]_
