Measure words
=============
Use a measure word in a sentence when stating the quantity of a thing (e.g. apple, friend).
The measure word to be used depends on the type of the thing.

Rule: number + measure word + noun

Example: 
| Yī **gè** péngyǒu (一个朋友).

   One friend.

**Reference:** [YLC21]_
    
Two consecutive falling tones
=============================
When one falling tone is followed by another falling tone, the first falling tone is replaced by a rising tone [YLC7]_.
 
Example: Wǒ búshì jiānádà rén (我不是加拿大人) which means "I am not canadian"

   Here we initially have bùshì (two falling tones) which should be replaced with búshì.

   Google translate doesn't seem to follow this rule since it uses instead bùshì for translating "I am not". [GTFT]_
